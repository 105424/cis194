-- EX 2
-- write a function with the type

-- battle :: Battlefield -> Rand StdGen Battlefield
--
-- ...which simulates a single battle (as explained above)
-- between two opposing armies. That is, it should simulate
-- randomly rolling the appropriate number of dice,
-- interpreting the results, and updating the two armies to
-- reflect casualties. You may assume that each player will
-- attack or defend with the maximum number of units they
-- are allowed.

-- rule 1:
-- The attacking player may attack with up to three units
-- at a time. However, they must always leave at least one
-- unit behind.

-- The defending player may defend with up to two units (or
-- only one if that is all they have).

dfd :: Army -> (Army, Army)
dfd a = (participated, chilled)
  where participated = min 2 a
        chilled      = a - participated

-- rule 3:
-- To determine the outcome of a single battle, the
-- attacking and defending players each roll one six-sided
-- die for every unit they have attacking or defending. So
-- the attacking player rolls one, two, or three dice, and
-- the defending player rolls one or two dice.

-- rule 4:
-- The attacking player sorts their dice rolls in
-- descending order. The defending player does the same.

-- which runs invade 1000 times, and uses the results to

-- estimated probability that the attacking army will
-- completely destroy the defending army.

-- For example, if the defending army is destroyed in 300
-- of the 1000 simulations (but the attacking army is
-- reduced to 1 unit in the other 700), successProb should
